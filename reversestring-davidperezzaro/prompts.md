Take on the role of an experienced Frontend Developer.

I want to create a web page in HTML with javascript logic that reverses the order of a string.

The user interface should have a title and an input field.

For each key stroke within the input field if the value length is greater than 1 the reverse logic will be applied to the input field value and the resulting string will be displayed below it alongside a button that will copy the result value to the OS clipboard. If the input value length is 0 or 1 no logic will be applied and both the result text and copy button won't be displayed.

The solution should be given in two separate files, index.html for the UI and script.js for all the logic. I have attached an initial seed for index.html
